Quantify awfulness in legal writing

Legal writing can be terrible, but it doesn't have to be. This project aims to help quantify awfulness in legal writing. It follows in the footsteps of efforts to quantify readability of texts such as the Flesch–Kincaid, SMOG, and similar methods, but with a focus on legal writing's own peculiar failings.
